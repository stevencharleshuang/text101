  storyText: "Your hand closes around some sort of stick object. A light from within
    the stick begins to illuminate and the stick ignites from one end into a blazing
    torch.\n\nYou can now see your surroundings and looking down at your newfound
    torch and best friend, you notice that the handle has some glowing glyphs on it.
    \n\nYou conclude that this torch is obviously enchanted and has magical properties
    of which you're not entirely certain of. \n\nYou wonder if you should press onward
    into the depths of the cave in search of escape or if you should run straight
    back to the battle of the Balls and exact revenge on them with this powerful(?)
    new weapon(?) of yours.\n\nChoose:\n1. Fuck those Balls, what's on the otherside
    of this bitch?\n2. Fuck thiose Balls, TO THE DEAAAAATH"
